                <p>Judy is a lifelong fiber artist who, taught by her grandmothers, is experienced in knitting, crochet, spinning,
                    design and pattern writing. Details in the work bring her joy. She is a test/sample knitter for many renowned
                    designers and companies.</p>
                <p>Born and raised on a farm in the upper Great Plains, Judy has taken her lifelong fiber skills to the heights
                    some knitters only dream of. She has designed knitting patterns, many of which are currently available online.
                    The sample sweaters she has knitted for an international knitting magazine have been photographed and published,
                    some featured on the magazine covers. Judy knits professionally for high profile knitwear designers and yarn
                    companies. She teaches both in class format and privately and judges fiber and needlework at the local county
                    fair.</p>
                <p>Judy has many skills including the patience to break down a knitted piece and translate it to graph for professional
                    designers for publication. She also is a caring teacher, support and friend to her many knitting buddies.
                    Tuesday evenings she can be found at her local knit night which she has attended since the group started
                    in1999. She enjoys the challenge of helping other knitters find and repair errors and accidental “design
                    features”. She is also an excellent spinner and has many antique spinning wheels.</p>
                <p>Judy and her husband have two daughters, four granddaughters and one grandson. Three of the granddaughters were
                    taught to knit by their Grandma Judy while still in grade school. Judy’s grandmothers would be proud.</p>
